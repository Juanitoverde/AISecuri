AI-Driven Security Assistant

Overview

Welcome to the AI-Driven Security Assistant project! This repository contains the code and resources for a powerful AI-driven tool designed to help security researchers and companies secure their infrastructure and websites. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, this assistant provides real-time vulnerability assessments, automated incident response, and actionable security recommendations. Our goal is to create a versatile and intelligent security assistant that continuously learns and adapts to new threats, ensuring your systems remain secure.

Features

Real-Time Vulnerability Assessment: Automatically scan your infrastructure and websites for known vulnerabilities and potential security risks.
Automated Incident Response: Detect security incidents in real time and provide immediate response actions to mitigate threats.
Security Recommendations: Receive tailored security recommendations based on the latest best practices and specific industry needs.
Training and Awareness: Interactive training modules for employees and IT staff to improve security awareness and preparedness.
Integration with Existing Tools: Seamlessly integrate with popular security tools and provide APIs for custom integrations.
Continuous Learning: Continuously improve the AI's knowledge base using data from incidents and assessments.
User-Friendly Dashboard: Centralized dashboard for monitoring security status, incidents, and recommendations.
Technical Details

Core Application
The core application handles scanning, analysis, and incident response. It is developed using Python and integrates with various security tools to provide a comprehensive security solution.

AI and LLM Integration
We utilize ChatGPT for natural language processing and interactive features. Machine learning models are employed for anomaly detection and pattern recognition.

Plugin System
A flexible plugin system allows for adding new functionalities without modifying the core application. Example plugins include:

VulnerabilityScanner.py: Scans and analyzes websites for vulnerabilities.
IncidentResponder.py: Handles automated incident response actions.
TrainingModule.py: Provides interactive security training modules.
Database
A NoSQL database is used to store security data, logs, and configurations. The database is secured and encrypted to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

API and Web Interface
A RESTful API allows for interaction with the core application and plugins. A web-based dashboard provides an intuitive interface for users to monitor and manage security.
